# Building
To Build a versus project you can use the jsar cli

To check if versus jsar is installed run the:
```
versus-jsar version
```
command to check if it installed or not.

If it is installed then you can proceed with the documentation if not you can go to the [Installation](https://versuscli.github.io/docs/installation.html) page and redo the installation so you can continue from here once your done.

To start building use the jsar cli to build using:
```
versus-jsar build
```
And it should start building...  

Once built you should see 2 folders named:
```
> out (The jsar file output)
> build
```

You should see the jsar file into the out folder once build has completed.
