# Installation

To install Versus CLI use:
- Newer Versions
```
npm install --location=global versus.js
```
- Older Versions (This may or may not work in older version because it's built on node's latest version)
```
npm install --global versus.js
```

## After Installation
So after installation you can run
```
versus version
```
or
```
versus --help
```
To check if the cli has installed successfully without any issues.  
Make sure versus version is the latest version because older versions may have issues.
